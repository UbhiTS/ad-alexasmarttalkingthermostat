# Alexa (& Sonos) Smart Talking Thermostat

Alexa becomes the voice for your thermostat. And, take control of your thermostat like never before. Extremely "Street Smart"!
- **Your Thermostat Speaks What It's Doing**: **Alexa & HA together are Awesome!**
- **Enforce Temp Limits**: your guests just can't crank up the heat or cold, saving you $$$
- **Daily Shut Off**: no more forgetting to turn off the thermostat and let it run whole day while you are away 
- **Enforce Fan Mode Auto**: Does not allow your fan to aimlessly be on, this can be used with the Air Cycle Feature to get the best of both worlds, save $$$ and cycle air 
- **Air Cycle Feature**: Cycles are at defined interval between your house and the rooms. If you have temp difference in rooms in your house, this will solve it!
- **Open Door/Window Shut Off**: AC turns off if a door or window is left open for 60 seconds. Works specially well with your kids ;)

Ever since we've set this up in our home, we cannot imaging our home without it. Your home suddenly gets a voice, something like Jarvis ... Awesome !
