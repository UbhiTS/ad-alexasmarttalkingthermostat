Alexa (or other Smart Speakers) become the voice for your thermostat. Take control of your thermostat like never before. Extremely "Street Smart"!
- **Your Thermostat Speaks What It's Doing**: **Alexa & HA together are :gem:Awesome!:gem:**
- **Enforce Temp Limits**: your guests just can't crank up the heat :hotsprings: or cold :snowflake:, saving you :dollar::dollar::dollar: 
- **Daily Shut Off**: no more forgetting to turn off the thermostat and let it run whole day while you are away 
- **Enforce Fan Mode Auto**: Does not allow your fan to aimlessly be on, this can be used with the Air Cycle Feature to get the best of both worlds, save :dollar::dollar::dollar: and cycle air 
- **Air Cycle Feature**: Cycles air at the defined interval between the rooms in your house. If you have temp difference in rooms in your house, or a room has stagnant air, and just smells funny :trollface:, this will solve it!
- **Open Door/Window Shut Off**: AC turns off if a door :door: or window :city_sunrise: is left open for 60 seconds. Works specially well with your kids :girl::girl: ;)

Ever since we've set this up in our home, we cannot imaging our home without it. Your home suddenly gets a voice, something like Jarvis ... Awesome!
